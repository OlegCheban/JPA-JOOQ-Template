# JPA-JOOQ-Template
A Spring Boot template for high-performance database operations, combining JPA (Hibernate) for ORM and JOOQ for type-safe SQL.

## ðŸŒŸ **Why This Template?**
Jumpstart your projects with zero boilerplate setup! This template delivers:
- **Pre-configured modern stack**: Spring Boot, JPA, JOOQ, Liquibase, and Testcontainers work seamlessly together out of the box.
- **Always up-to-date**: All libraries use the latest stable versions, enforced by Dependabot for automatic security/version updates.
- **Liquibase session-level LockService implementations**: Tired of dealing with locks on the DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK table? Session-level locks get automatically released if the database connection drops.
